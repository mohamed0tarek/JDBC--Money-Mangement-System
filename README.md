# Tools

# How works
when you run the application, There are processes you will go through : <br>
**1. Authentication** <br>
First you have to sign in with id and password either you were a client or an admin.

**2. Do Operations** <br>
List of operations will appear. And user can choose what he want to execute. of course clients and admins have different list of tasks they can do as I refered above.

**3. Transactions rules** <br>
All Transactions rules have been taken care of. Before commiting any transaction there are conditions to check. if all these transactions have been taken place successfully. If so, transaction commited. If not, transaction rollback.
